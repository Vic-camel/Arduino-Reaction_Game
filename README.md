* it will begin when you press the button called 3 in the red rectangle on the photo.
* When the game starts, lights will flicker. 
If lights are close,you have to press button 1.
Then screen shows reaction time and goes to next level. 
* There are three levels in the game,and time between levels would get more and more shorter.
If you don't pressing button 3 in 2.5 sec as the lights closed,you would fail the game.
